# LCM-LAI
In this fold, we implement the proposed Legal Case Retrieval(LCR) model, named **l**egal **c**ase
**m**atching **n**etwork of **l**aw **a**rticle **i**ntervention **(LCM-LAI)**, which evaluates 
the juridical consistency between cases by referring to the relevance of the article reference 
distributions of cases. Besides, model also considers the semantic similarity of cases by evaluating
the context of cases. By combining both semantic similarity and juridical consistency between cases, 
this model achieves outstanding experimental performance.
